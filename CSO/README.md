# [CSO](https://www.cso.ie) Data Overview

Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO) collects data on many aspects of Irish Society. The data can be downloaded from their website. 

They mostly work with data
in
[*PX-file*](https://www.scb.se/globalassets/vara-tjanster/px-programmen/pc-axis_fileformat-2008.pdf) which
is a data file apparently used by a statistics programme called
[*PxWin*](https://www.scb.se/px-en) (formerly *PC-Axis*) and
possibly
[a number of others](https://www.scb.se/en/services/statistical-programs-for-px-files/).

Convert PX files to Pandas:

- [pyaxis](https://github.com/icane/pyaxis)  (more recent?)
- [py3-opendata](https://github.com/ljleppan/py3-opendata)

Sample of Available data:
